### Scenario   


hi 
--- 
## 1. Ask    

Task: Analyze Fitbit data to gain insight and help guide marketing strategy for Bellabeat to grow as a global player.   
Stakeholders: Urška Sršen and Sando Mur (executive team members), and the Bellabeat marketing analytics team
## 2. Prepare   
Data Source: 30 participants FitBit Fitness Tracker Data from Mobius: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit    

The dataset contains limitations:   
* The sample size is 30 people, which is not representative of the true population that uses Bellabeat products.
* There are 28 IDs that do not show up on either the weight log or sleep log table, so some records are missing. 
* The dataset is from 2016, so user habits from 6 years ago may be different.     


The dataset contains 18 CSV files, and aligns with the ROCCC approach:
* Reliability: The data contains data from 30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data and a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
* Original: The data is from 30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
* Comprehensive: For physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring, the data is represented in minutes. Though the data tracks a variety of factors that influence a user’s activity level, the sample size is on the smaller side.
* Current: Data is from March 2016 to May 2016. The dataset is 6 years old as of date of analysis, so user habits may be different now.
* Cited: Unknown.
